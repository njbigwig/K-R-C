While attending Monmouth College (now University), I was a Bell Labs summer intern lucky enough to be approved for a 1 week training course on the C Programming Language at Murray Hill, NJ. We received this book and the course binder was 4 inches thick. You certainly learned to program C that week!!!  That course changed my life.

I am creating this repro to continue to learn how to use GitHub and share my love of the language.
